# index.php
A single PHP file that is designed to run an entire website using Apache's mod_rewrite to effect seemingly static files and SEO-friendly URIs.

Hello and welcome to an as-of-yet unnamed project currently called index.php since that is exactly all it really is. This project aims to provide an extremely simplified installation of a highly modular content management system that can host forums, imageboard, galleries, chatrooms, web logs, knowledge bases and even web-based applications. The purpose of this project is to offer an alternative to the many existing but largely incompatible or difficult to install/combine systems for site administrators that want to combine features of various site types but for which no suitable platform exists.

2015 07 27 - Project start.
  The next commit will be the actual index.php file itself with a basic framework to parse simple and common tasks that will be needed almost universally by any PHP file. The script should run without errors, output no data and return with a value of 0.
